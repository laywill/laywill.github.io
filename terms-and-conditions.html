<br>3.1              William Lay shall hire the Equipment to the Customer for use in accordance with the Quotation and these Conditions. William Lay reserves the right to substitute any of the Equipment for a similar piece of equipment of comparable quality if necessitated by William Lay’s lack of available equipment or any applicable statutory or regulatory requirements or if it reasonably considers that any proposed Equipment may not be suitable for the Event following its assessment of the Venue pursuant to clause 8.4. William Lay shall notify the Customer in any such event.<br>
<br>3.2              William Lay shall not interfere with the Customer’s quiet possession of the Equipment, other than where William Lay is to set-up and/or operate the Equipment, or save in the exercise of William Lay’s rights under these Conditions or applicable law.<br>
<br>3.3              The Customer shall:<br>
<br>3.3.1                look after the Equipment as a reasonable owner of such Equipment would;<br>

<br><br>
<br>4                   Quality of Equipment
<br>4.1              William Lay warrants that on delivery and for the duration of the Hire Period, the Equipment shall conform in all material respects with its description and be fit for any purpose notified by the Customer to William Lay for which the Equipment is required.<br>
<br>4.2              Subject to clause 4.3, if the Customer notifies William Lay during the Hire Period within a reasonable time of discovery that some or all of the Equipment does not comply with the warranty set out in clause 4.1, William Lay shall, at its option, repair or replace the defective Equipment as soon as practicable.<br>
<br>4.3              William Lay shall not be liable for the Equipment’s failure to comply with the warranty in clause 4.1 if:<br>
<br>4.3.1                the Customer makes any further use of such Equipment after notifying William Lay in accordance with clause 4.2;<br>
<br>4.3.2                the failure arises because the Customer failed to follow William Lay’s oral or written instructions as to the storage, installation, commissioning, use or maintenance of the Equipment;<br>
<br>4.3.3                the Customer alters or repairs such Equipment without William Lay’s consent;<br>
<br>4.3.4                the failure arises as a result of the wilful damage or negligence of the Customer; or<br>
<br>4.3.5                the failure arises as a result of a Force Majeure Event.<br>
<br>4.4              The terms of these Conditions shall apply to any repaired or replacement Equipment supplied by William Lay under clause 4.2.<br>
<br><br>
<br>5                   Collection or Delivery of Equipment<br>
<br>5.1              If the Customer is to collect the Equipment, the Customer shall collect the Equipment from such location as is notified by William Lay to the Customer within any timeframe and/or before any deadline specified in the Quotation but in any event before close of business on the date of commencement of the Hire Period.  Delivery of the Equipment shall be completed on completion of loading of the Equipment onto the Customer’s transport at such location.<br>
<br>5.2              If William Lay is to deliver the Equipment, William Lay shall deliver the Equipment to the location set out in the Quotation by the date and time specified in the Quotation. Delivery of the Equipment shall be completed on the Equipment’s arrival at such location. The Customer shall be responsible for ensuring that there are adequate parking/unloading facilities available at the delivery location.<br>
<br>5.3              Time for availability for collection or delivery (as the case may be) of the Equipment shall be of the essence.  However William Lay shall not be liable for any delay in the Equipment being available for collection or delivered which is caused by a Force Majeure Event, the Venue not being ready for William Lay to deliver the Equipment, or the Customer’s failure to provide William Lay with adequate delivery instructions or any other instructions which are relevant to the supply of the Equipment.<br>
<br><br>
<br>6                   Return of Equipment<br>
<br>6.1              The Customer shall deliver up the Equipment at the end of the Hire Period or on earlier termination of the Contract either by returning it to such address as William Lay requires or by allowing William Lay or its representatives to collect the Equipment – whichever is stated in the Quotation or subsequently agreed by the parties.<br>
<br>6.2              The Customer shall not be liable for any delay in the Equipment being returned to William Lay at the end of the Hire Period or upon earlier termination of the Contract which is caused by a Force Majeure Event or William Lay’s failure to provide the Customer with adequate delivery instructions or any other instructions which are relevant to the return of the Equipment. In any other circumstances, if the Equipment is not returned to William Lay by the end of the Hire Period or earlier termination of the Contract, William Lay reserves the right to charge the Customer an additional fee up to the price of hire of the Equipment in respect of the period from the end of the Hire Period or earlier termination of the Contract until the Equipment is returned.<br>
<br><br>
<br>7                   Damage to or Loss of Equipment<br>
<br>7.1              The Customer shall be liable for any loss, theft, damage or destruction to the Equipment which occurs between completion of delivery in accordance with clause 5.1 or 5.2 (as appropriate) and return to William Lay in accordance with clause 6, unless:<br>
<br>7.1.1                such loss, theft, damage or destruction is caused by an act or omission of an employee, agent, consultant or subcontractor of William Lay;<br>
<br>7.1.2                the Customer has paid the Damage Waiver and has complied with William Lay’s reasonable instructions and has behaved reasonably as an owner of the Equipment would; or<br>
<br>7.1.3                such loss, theft, damage or destruction is caused by a Force Majeure Event, and the Customer has complied with William Lay’s reasonable instructions and has behaved reasonably as an owner of the Equipment would.<br>
<br>7.2              The Customer’s liability pursuant to clause 7.1 shall include the obligation to pay to William Lay an amount equal to the cost to William Lay of repair or replacement (as William Lay may in its reasonable discretion decide) of the Equipment, together with such costs and losses as William Lay may incur as a direct consequence of such loss, theft, damage or destruction, including (for example) in relation to any subsequent scheduled hires of the Equipment.<br>
<br>7.3              The Customer shall give immediate written notice to William Lay in the event of any loss, theft, damage or destruction to the Equipment occurring during or arising out of or in connection with the Customer’s possession or use of the Equipment.<br>
<br><br>

<br>8.1              William Lay shall provide the Services to the Customer in accordance with the Quotation in all material respects. For the avoidance of doubt, the Services do not extend to the provision of advice in respect of the Customer’s compliance with legislation unless specifically stated in the Quotation or otherwise expressly agreed between the parties.<br>
<br>8.2              William Lay shall have the right to make any changes to the Services which are necessary to comply with any applicable law or safety requirement, or which do not materially affect the nature or quality of the Services, and William Lay shall notify the Customer in any such event.<br>
<br>8.3              William Lay warrants to the Customer that the Services will be provided using reasonable care and skill.<br>

<br>8.4.1                the Customer shall provide or procure the provision of such information as William Lay shall reasonably require concerning the facilities, lay-out and suitability of the Venue (on which information William Lay may rely); and/or<br>

The Customer shall provide William Lay with such co-operation and assistance as it may reasonably request from the Customer in connection with any visit to and assessment of the Venue.  William Lay shall have the right to make changes to or replace the Equipment, or make changes to the Services, or alter the charges or otherwise vary the terms of the Contract, in any case to the extent it reasonably considers necessary in the light of information provided concerning the set-up at the Venue after the issue of the Quotation or of findings from its own assessment of the set-up at the Venue made after the issue of the Quotation.<br>
<br><br>

<br>9.1              The Customer shall:<br>

<br>9.1.10               provide William Lay, its employees, agents, consultants and subcontractors with good quality overnight accommodation in a suitable location relating to The Venue, with a maximum of one person per room unless agreed in writing in advance, and not to be shared with any persons unrelated to the Contract or Quotation; and<br>

<br>9.2              If William Lay’s performance of any of its obligations in respect of the Services is prevented, delayed or otherwise adversely affected by any act or omission of the Customer or failure by the Customer to perform any relevant obligation under clause 9.1 or otherwise (Customer Default):<br>
<br>9.2.1                William Lay shall without limiting its other rights or remedies have the right to suspend performance of the Services until the Customer remedies the Customer Default, and to rely on the Customer Default to relieve it from the performance of any of its obligations to the extent the Customer Default prevents or delays William Lay’s performance of any of its obligations;<br>
<br>9.2.2                William Lay shall not be liable for any costs or losses sustained or incurred by the Customer arising directly or indirectly from William Lay’s failure or delay to perform any of its obligations as set out in this clause 9.2; and<br>

<br><br>
<br>10                Variation of Contract (including postponement and cancellation)<br>
<br>10.1           The Customer shall inform William Lay as soon as reasonably practicable if the Event is postponed or cancelled. William Lay may charge the Customer a fee of an amount up to the aggregate of the charges for the Services it has provided and the third party disbursements it has incurred before the time it is so notified. William Lay shall invoice the Customer for such charges on or at any time after it receives such notification.<br>
<br>10.2           Any additional services or equipment required or requested by the Customer which are not set out in the Quotation, or which are necessitated as a result of the set-up at the Venue being different from that notified to William Lay or apparent from William Lay’s inspection (as contemplated in clause 8.4), shall be charged at the rates agreed by the parties or, in the absence of agreement, at rates reasonably determined by William Lay.  For the avoidance of doubt the terms of these Conditions shall apply to any such additional services or equipment.<br>
<br><br>
<br>11                Charges and Payment<br>
<br>11.1           The charges for the hire of the Equipment and the provision of the Services shall be as set out in the Quotation, although such charges may be altered to the extent provided in the Contract.<br>
<br>11.2           A charge equal to 12% of the total charges for the hire of the Equipment shall be made by William Lay to the Customer (Damage Waiver) unless the Customer can show to the reasonable satisfaction of William Lay that it has sufficient insurance in place in respect of loss, theft, damage or destruction to the Equipment.<br>
<br>11.3           Except where expressly provided otherwise in the Quotation or Conditions, William Lay shall invoice the Customer on or at any time after the end of the Hire Period.<br>
<br>11.4           The Customer shall pay each invoice submitted by William Lay within 30 days of the date of the invoice. Time for payment shall be of the essence of the Contract.

<br>11.5           Without limiting any other right or remedy of William Lay, if the Customer fails to make any payment due to William Lay under the Contract by the due date for payment, William Lay may charge the Customer interest and such other sums as may be payable in respect of the overdue amount pursuant to the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998.<br>
<br>11.6           The Customer shall pay all amounts due under the Contract in full without any deduction or withholding except as required by law and the Customer shall not be entitled to assert any credit, set-off or counterclaim against William Lay in order to justify withholding payment of any such amount in whole or in part. William Lay may, without limiting its other rights or remedies, set off any amount owing to it by the Customer against any amount payable by William Lay to the Customer.<br>
<br>11.7          Where applications for credit are requested we will supply your personal information to credit reference agencies (CRAs) and they will give us information about you, such as about your financial history. We do this to assess creditworthiness and product suitability, check your identity, manage your account, trace and recover debts and prevent criminal activity. We will also continue to exchange information about you with CRAs on an ongoing basis, including about your settled accounts and any debts not fully repaid on time. CRAs will share your information with other organisations.<br>
<br><br>
<br>12                Security for Payment<br>
<br>12.1           William Lay shall be entitled to require a payment on account of its eventual charges upon formation of the Contract or any time thereafter. Such payment shall be applied against William Lay’s invoices in respect of the Contract, and to the extent that the payment on account exceeds William Lay’s total eventual charges, shall be returned to the Customer as soon as reasonably practicable after William Lay’s final invoice in respect of the Contract is issued.<br>
<br>12.2           William Lay shall be entitled to require a guarantee or other form of security it reasonably considers appropriate in respect of the Customer’s obligations upon formation of the Contract or any time thereafter.<br>
<br>12.3           Failure by the Customer to provide the assurances requested by William Lay pursuant to clause 12.1 or 12.2 shall entitle William Lay to terminate the Contract immediately upon notice to the Customer.<br>
<br><br>
<br>13                Intellectual Property Rights<br>
<br>13.1           Where any products of the Services are designed, created or otherwise developed by William Lay for the Customer pursuant to the Contract, the Intellectual Property Rights in, arising out of or in connection with such products shall be owned by William Lay.<br>
<br>13.2           William Lay hereby grants a royalty-free, non-transferable, non-exclusive licence to the Customer to use such products only for the purposes of and during the Event.<br>
<br>13.3           Any materials provided by the Customer to William Lay to enable it to produce such products shall remain the exclusive property of the Customer.<br>
<br><br>
<br>14                Confidentiality<br>
<br>A party (Receiving Party) shall keep in strict confidence all technical or commercial know-how, specifications, inventions, processes or initiatives which are of a confidential nature and have been disclosed to the Receiving Party by the other party (Disclosing Party), its employees, agents or subcontractors, and any other confidential information concerning the Disclosing Party’s business or its products or its services which the Receiving Party may obtain. The Receiving Party shall restrict disclosure of such confidential information to such of its employees, agents or subcontractors as need to know it for the purpose of discharging the Receiving Party’s obligations under the Contract, and shall ensure that such employees, agents or subcontractors are subject to obligations of confidentiality corresponding to those which bind the Receiving Party. This clause 14 shall survive termination of the Contract.<br>
<br><br>
<br>15                Limitation of Liability: THE CUSTOMER’S ATTENTION IS PARTICULARLY DRAWN TO THIS CLAUSE<br>
<br>15.1           Nothing in these Conditions shall limit or exclude William Lay’s liability for:<br>

<br>15.1.2             fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or<br>
